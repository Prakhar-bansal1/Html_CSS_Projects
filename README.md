# Html_CSS_Projects

This repository contains all of the basic and advanced projects I have created while learning HTML and CSS. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.

## Project List

Here are the list of projects that I have completed so far:

- **Project 1**: A simple web page that displays my name, photo, and some information about myself.
- **Project 2**: A responsive web page that adapts to different screen sizes and devices using media queries and flexbox.
- **Project 3**: A landing page for a fictional company that showcases its products, features, and testimonials using grid layout and animations.
- **Project 4**: A portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and contact details using Bootstrap framework and Font Awesome icons.
- **Project 5**: A blog website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts using HTML forms and local storage.
